# Tableau-vizualisations

The first visualization, named Sales Story, takes in the Sample superstore data and visualizes its sales based on Year, State, and Region. A twbx file is attached for 
viewing the data source and attributes used for creating the viz.


The second Tableau visualization depicts the effect opioid crisis in the United States, and drills down the data to show the numbers within Delaware state. This was 
the final assignment I did for my Big Data and visualization course. It utilizes multiple data sources, as well as a dashboard, to highlight the opioid crisis overall,
and among various demographics. The data sources can be accessed through the twbx file.
